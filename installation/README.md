# Installation

Before going any further, make sure you have: `Java 8` and `git` installed on your computer.

Then, clone the project and create a directory that will contain all your "infrastructure" executables

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WeeFin/twitter_demo.git
mkdir platform
cd platform
```
